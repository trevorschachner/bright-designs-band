## Testing Your Setup

### 1. Test Contact Form Locally

1. **Start your development server**:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Visit the contact form**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/contact`

3. **Submit a test form**:
   - Fill out all required fields
   - Use a real email address you can check
   - Submit the form

4. **Check results**:
   - You should see a success message
   - Check your email for the confirmation
   - Admin emails should receive the notification

### 2. Check Email Delivery

**If using Resend**:
- Check your Resend dashboard for delivery status
- Look for any bounce or error messages

**If using Gmail**:
- Check your Gmail sent folder
- Verify the App Password is correct (16 characters, no spaces)

**If emails aren't working**:
- Check the browser console for errors
- Check your server logs
- Verify environment variables are set correctly

### 3. Database Verification

Check that submissions are being saved:

```sql
-- Connect to your database and run:
SELECT * FROM contact_submissions ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "No email service configured"**
- Verify your environment variables are in `.env.local`
- Restart your development server after adding variables
- Make sure you're using the correct variable names

**2. Gmail "Authentication failed"**
- Ensure 2-factor authentication is enabled
- Use an App Password, not your regular password
- Remove any spaces from the App Password

**3. Resend "Invalid API key"**
- Check your API key in the Resend dashboard
- Ensure it starts with "re_"
- Make sure you're using the correct domain

**4. "Too many submissions"**
- Wait 5 minutes between test submissions
- Rate limiting is per email address
- Use different email addresses for testing

**5. Form not submitting**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure all required fields are filled
- Check that privacy policy is checked

### Development vs Production

**Development**:
- Use Resend's test domain for easy setup
- Send emails to your own addresses
- Lower rate limits for testing

**Production**:
- Use your verified domain with Resend
- Set up SPF/DKIM records for better deliverability
- Monitor email delivery rates
- Set up proper admin email addresses

## Next Steps

2. **Test the contact form** thoroughly
3. **Set up database migration** for contact submissions
4. **Configure your admin email addresses**
5. **Test in production** before going live
